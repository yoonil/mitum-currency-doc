.. note::
   * Mitum provides only basic network interface (API) such as sending and receiving block and voting messages
   * The transaction history or status of the account is not provided by Mitum as a separate API.
   * These additional APIs are provided through a separate API service (**planned**)
   * To check the result of account creation, transmission, and key update in this document, you need to search mongodb directly.
